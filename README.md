## Career Recommender System Project

### Overview

The Career Recommender System project aims to assist individuals in identifying potential career paths based on their skills, interests, and preferences. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost to make personalized career recommendations.

## Dataset

The project uses a carefully curated dataset containing information about various careers, including job descriptions, required skills, educational qualifications, and job satisfaction ratings. Additionally, individual user data, including skills, interests, and preferred work environment, is collected through user surveys to create personalized profiles.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: This phase involves gathering career-related data and individual user data. The data is then preprocessed, which includes cleaning, transforming, and merging datasets as needed.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, relevant features are extracted from the datasets, and user profiles are created using the collected data.

3. **Data Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns and relationships between careers and user preferences.

4. **Training Models**: Machine learning models (Decision Tree, SVM, and XGBoost) are trained to map user preferences to potential career options and make personalized recommendations.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Career Recommendations**: The trained models are used to make personalized career recommendations for users based on their individual profiles.
